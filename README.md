# Google-AI-Studio-MacOS-Overlay
**This tool is inspired by *macos-grok-overlay* by tchlux**

Frustrated with OpenAI or ChatGPT's performance? Want to try Google Gemini but prefer a dedicated client over a website for better efficiency? This tool offers a solution. Similar to the 'Option + Space' shortcut in ChatGPT client, it provides overlay window access. However, instead of limiting you to one conversation, this tool grants broader access to Gemini's features within the overlay. Further more, accessing Gemini in Google AI Studio allows you much more free tokens and access to their latest models.
